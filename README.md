The change in lifestyle and rapid urbanization leads to change in food habits due to which people are more attracted towards fast food consumption. Fast food consumption has rapidly grown, impacting public lifestyle, health impact and affecting
their bodies. This project aims to analyze fast food consumption in India and its food impact via tools like Power BI. The analysis focuses on analyzing KPI (key performance interface), visualizations trends and getting insights related to
people’s health behaviors and their lifestyle.

**Objective**
The primary objective of this project is to:
▪ To design and analyze the dashboard using Power BI.
▪ To analyze fast food consumption and food impact in India.
▪ To identify KPI related to health and diet.
▪ To identify the purpose of each chart according to its needs.
▪ To uncover risks, trends, patterns related to health using visualization.
▪ To learn about data analytics each process.
▪ To clean and model different data sources.
▪ To compare effectiveness of Excel and Power BI for creating a dashboard.

The value indicates that the population is borderline overweight, highlighting rising health risks associated with dietary habits.

2.Average Fast Food Meals per Week
Shows the average number of fast food meals consumed weekly.
A value close to 7 meals suggests frequent fast food dependency, increasing lifestyle-related health risks.

3.Average Health Score
